# Angular Overview

Angular is a powerful framework for building modern single-page applications (SPAs). SPAs interact with the user by dynamically rewriting the current web page with new data from the web server, providing a more seamless and responsive user experience compared to traditional page-based navigation.

## Key Features:

- **Component-Based Framework:**
  Angular follows a component-based architecture, where the application is divided into reusable and independent components. Each component encapsulates a specific feature or functionality.

- **Clean Separation of Template Coding and Application Logic:**
  Angular promotes a clean separation between the template (user interface) and the application logic. This separation enhances maintainability and readability of code.

- **Built-in Support for Data-Binding and Dependency Injection:**
  Angular offers powerful features like two-way data binding and dependency injection, making it easier to manage the flow of data and dependencies within the application.

- **Supports Responsive Web Design and Modern Frameworks:**
  Angular provides out-of-the-box support for responsive web design and integrates seamlessly with popular frameworks like Bootstrap and Angular Material.

## Benefits of Using Angular:

- **Clean Structure:**
  Angular helps organize your application into a well-defined structure, making it easier to understand and maintain.

- **Reusable Code:**
  The component-based architecture of Angular encourages the creation of reusable code components, reducing redundancy and improving development efficiency.

- **Testability:**
  Angular's architecture, with its clean separation of concerns, facilitates unit testing, making it easier to ensure the reliability of your application.

## Angular Architecture

### 1. Component:

The main player in an Angular application, consisting of a view for the user interface and a class containing application logic and event handling for the view.

### 2. View Template:

The user interface for the component, featuring static HTML with dynamic elements that are updated based on data and events.

### 3. Directive:

Adds custom behavior to HTML elements, used for tasks such as looping, conditionals, and other dynamic functionalities.

### 4. Service:

A helper class providing desired functionality, such as retrieving data from a server, performing calculations, or handling validation.

### 5. Module:

A collection of related components, directives, services, etc., helping organize and modularize an Angular application.

## Project File Structure:

- **angular.json:**
  Angular workspace configuration and a list of execution targets.

- **node_modules:**
  Local repository of Node.js modules, managed by npm.

- **package.json:**
  Project's list of Node dependencies and scripts.

- **src:**
  Main source directory containing application code.

    - **app:**
      Components, templates, and application logic.

    - **assets:**
      Images and other static assets.

    - **environments:**
      Profiles for different environments (dev, test, prod, etc.).

    - **index.html:**
      Main launch page for the application.

    - **polyfills.ts:**
      Adds support for different browser versions.

    - **test.ts:**
      Unit test cases for the application.

    - **tsconfig files:**
      TypeScript compiler configuration files.

## `<app-root>` in Angular:

`<app-root>` is a custom tag used by Angular, acting as a selector for the root component. It serves as a placeholder in the HTML where the content of the component will be rendered, functioning like an "include" directive.

- The `<app-root>` tag is defined in an Angular component, annotated with the `@Component` decorator.
- The `templateUrl` property in the `@Component` decorator points to the HTML file containing the template for the component.
- When the Angular application runs, it replaces the `<app-root>` tag in the HTML with the content specified in the associated template file.

## Angular Files:

In an Angular application, several key files play vital roles in organizing and configuring the application.

### app.component.ts

This file defines the root component of the Angular application. It is typically located in the `src/app` directory. The component is annotated with the `@Component` decorator, which includes metadata like the selector, templateUrl, styleUrls, etc. The content of this file defines the structure and behavior of the root component, which is usually represented by the `<app-root>` tag in the HTML.

```typescript
// Example app.component.ts
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']
})
export class AppComponent {
  // Component logic goes here
}
```

### app.module.ts

This file defines the main module of the Angular application. It is typically located in the `src/app` directory. The module is annotated with the `@NgModule` decorator, which includes metadata about the module, such as declarations, imports, providers, etc. It imports other modules and declares components, directives, and pipes that are part of the application.

```typescript
// Example app.module.ts
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';

import { AppComponent } from './app.component';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    AppComponent
  ],
  imports: [
    BrowserModule
  ],
  providers: [],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule { }
```

### app-routing.module.ts

This file is used for configuring the application's routing functionality. It is typically located in the `src/app` directory. It defines the routes of the application, associating components with specific URLs. The `RouterModule` is configured with these routes.

```typescript
// Example app-routing.module.ts
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { RouterModule, Routes } from '@angular/router';

import { AppComponent } from './app.component';

const routes: Routes = [
  { path: '', component: AppComponent },
  // Add other routes as needed
];

@NgModule({
  imports: [RouterModule.forRoot(routes)],
  exports: [RouterModule]
})
export class AppRoutingModule { }
```

You then need to import `AppRoutingModule` in your `AppModule` to enable the routing features in your application.

These three files (`app.component.ts`, `app.module.ts`, and `app-routing.module.ts`) work together to define the structure, behavior, and routing of your Angular application.

## Structural Directives: (*ngFor and *ngIf)

Angular provides structural directives like *ngFor and *ngIf, which are used in templates to handle the structure of the DOM dynamically. *ngFor is used for looping, while *ngIf is used for conditionals.

## Angular CLI commands:

- **ng new <project-name>:**
  Creates a new Angular project.
- **ng serve:**
  Builds and serves the application, watching for file changes.
- **ng generate component <component-name>:**
  Generates a new component.
- **ng generate class <class-name>:**
  Generates a new class.
- **ng generate service <service-name>:**
  Generates a new service.
